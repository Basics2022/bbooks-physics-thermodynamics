# Principles of Thermal Engineering

Thermal enginnering is a discipline dealing with applications and systems for energy conversion and transfer through work and heat, usually involving other branches or field in physics/engineering, like [thermodynamics](), [fluid mechanics](), [heat transfer](), [mass transfer](), [chemistry](),...

Physical processes: continuum (usaully fluid) mechanics, mass and heat transfer, chemistry,...

Applications: power plants, heat engines (direct cycles); refrigerator systems (inverse cycles); heat exchangers; heating; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); thermal insulation,...
