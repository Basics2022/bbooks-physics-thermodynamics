# Heat transfer

Three main heat transfer mechanisms exist: conduction, convection, radiation.

[**Conduction**](classical-thermodynamics:heat-transmission:conduction). Main heat transfer mechanism in solid media: molecules of the solid are not free to move and conduction is a diffusion process of the microscopical thermal agitation of the molecules of the solid structure.

[**Convection**](classical-thermodynamics:heat-transmission:convection). Main heat transfer machanism in fluid media: moldeculus of the fluid are free to move; as they move, they transport "thermal energy" and xechange heat with the surrounding environment.

[**Radiation**](classical-thermodynamics:heat-transmission:radiation). It's the only heat transfer mechanism that needs no matter to occur, as it can occur in "vacuum"[^vacuum]


[^vacuum]: Vacuum of matter, mass, but not physical properties, as the dielectric constant and magnetic permeability of free space/"vacuum".
